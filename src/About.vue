          Hello! My name is Khoi and I am the main developer on this project.
          My responsibility is to implement new features
          and ensure the software works well.
        p.content.
          I am a pure mathematician by education.
          I got my MMath from the
          #[a(href="https://cam.ac.uk") University of Cambridge] in 2012,
          followed by a PhD from
          #[a(href="https://imperial.ac.uk") Imperial College] in 2016.
          I started teaching shortly afterwards,
          and obtained by PGCE from the
          #[a(href="https://ox.ac.uk") University of Oxford] in 2020.
          I now work as a Teacher of Mathematics at the
          #[a(href="https://kingscollegeschools.org/madrid/school/") British School of Madrid].
        p.content.
          Outside of teaching, I enjoy playing piano and table tennis.
          I represented Oxford's first team in the 77#[sup th]
          Table Tennis Varsity match against Cambridge.
