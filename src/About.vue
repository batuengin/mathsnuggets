          Hello to you, reader! We are two Teachers of Mathematics seeking to facilitate teaching and learning
          mathematics. Having met at the #[a(href="https://ox.ac.uk") University of Oxford] and enjoyed a short-lived
          PGCE course together, we decided to create this website to facilitate the creation of teaching resources.

          Hello! My name is Khoi and I am the main developer on this project.
          My responsibility is to implement new features
          and ensure the software works well.
        p.content.
          I am a pure mathematician by education.
          I got my MMath from the
          #[a(href="https://cam.ac.uk") University of Cambridge] in 2012,
          followed by a PhD from
          #[a(href="https://imperial.ac.uk") Imperial College] in 2016.
          I started teaching shortly afterwards,
          and obtained by PGCE from the
          #[a(href="https://ox.ac.uk") University of Oxford] in 2020.
          I now work as a Teacher of Mathematics at the
          #[a(href="https://kingscollegeschools.org/madrid/school/") British School of Madrid].
        p.content.
          Outside of teaching, I enjoy playing piano and table tennis.
          I represented Oxford's first team in the 77#[sup th]
          Table Tennis Varsity match against Cambridge.

        p.content.
          As you may have guessed, I am part French (half to be precise) and, as of September
          2020, a Teacher of Mathematics at Sandwell Academy. In 2019, I graduated from #[a(href="https://keele.ac.uk") Keele University]
          with a First-Class honours degree in Mathematics and obtained my PGCE qualification from the
          #[a(href="https://ox.ac.uk") University of Oxford] the following year.
        p.content.
          I am passionate about helping young people and enjoying life outside of teaching. My hobbies include
          competitive badminton, cooking great food and playing piano!
